# Contributions Welcome

This project is in a very early stage, and we welcome contributions from everyone. We hope to receive contributions and support in the following areas:

1. Support for more models. In addition to CogVideoX models, we also highly encourage contributions supporting other models.
2. Support for richer datasets. In our example, we used a Disney video generation dataset, but we hope to support more datasets as the current one is too limited for deeper fine-tuning exploration.
3. Anything in `TODO` we mention in our README.md

## How to Submit

We welcome you to create a new PR and describe the corresponding contribution. We will review it as soon as possible.

## Naming Conventions

- Please use English for naming, avoid using pinyin or other languages. All comments should be in English.
- Strictly follow PEP8 conventions, and use underscores to separate words. Please avoid using names like a, b, c.
